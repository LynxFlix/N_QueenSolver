# N-Queens Problem Solver

## Overview
The **N-Queens Problem** is a famous problem in computer science where the goal is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack another queen if they are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project provides a solution to the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm, implemented as a web application with Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features
- Solve the N-Queens problem for any `N â‰¥ 4`.
- Display all possible solutions as visually formatted chessboards.
- Easy-to-use web interface to enter the size of the chessboard.
- Displays all possible solutions (for example, for N=8, it shows 92 solutions).
- Provides a clean and modern UI with animations and styling for both input and result display.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Algorithm**: Backtracking


## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/N-queen_solver.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd N-queen_solver
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

7. Open your browser and visit:

## How It Works

- **Backend Logic**: 
  The backend is built using **Flask**, a Python web framework. The core logic for solving the N-Queens problem is implemented in `solver.py`, which uses a **backtracking algorithm** to find all solutions. The `solve_nqueens(n)` function is called to find all valid board configurations for a given `N`.

- **Frontend Interaction**:
  The user is presented with a form on the homepage (`index.html`), where they can input the size `N` of the chessboard. When the user submits the form, a POST request is sent to the server, which calculates the solutions and returns them to the frontend in a JSON format. The results are then displayed on the `result.html` page as chessboards.

- **CSS and Styling**:
  The chessboard and the entire page are styled using CSS, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Usage

1. **Input**: Enter the desired value of `N` (e.g., 4, 8, 10) and click the "Solve" button to get all the possible solutions for that N value.

2. **Display**: After solving, the results are displayed on the **result page** as visually formatted chessboards. Each valid solution will be shown as a grid with queens placed in the correct positions (marked as `Q`).

3. **Error Handling**:
    - If the input is not a valid integer, an error message will be displayed.
    - If `N` is less than 4, it will notify the user that there are no valid solutions for smaller values of `N`.

## Example

For `N = 4`, the two solutions would be displayed as:


and


For `N = 8`, the page will display 92 solutions, each formatted as a chessboard.

## Future Enhancements

- **Performance Optimization**: As the value of `N` increases, the number of solutions increases exponentially. Caching solutions or limiting the number of displayed solutions can improve performance.
- **Visualization Enhancements**: Add animations to visualize how queens are placed on the board.
- **Other Chessboard Variants**: Extend the application to solve other chessboard-based problems, such as the N-Rooks problem or the N-Knights problem.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improve the responsiveness of the design for mobile and tablet screens.
